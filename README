== Learn English Words

LEW is a simple Rails app for guys who would like to learn new English words.
I learned English words quite regularly and I was very disappointed by the amount
of time I had to spend on such routine tasks as finding the article about a word,
deciding which words are important and which are not. To make this process easier
and reduce this wasting of time I developed this simple app.


== Implemented Features

1. Creating and managing decks
2. AJAX way of creating and editing words
3. You can get the article about any word from Oxford Dictionary by one click
4. LEW marked all important and popular words automatically
5. A comprehensive algorithm of showing next words to repeat

== Planned Features

1. Such social activities as 'share a deck' e.t.c.
2. An easy way to add another word during the learning process
3. Suggesting new words to learn
4. Slick and sexy UI
5. Mobile version
